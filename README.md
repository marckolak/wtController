# Simple Raspberry Pi, Python based controlled for a robotic platform

The main goal of the project is to develop a controller for a Dagu Wild Thumper 6WD robotic platform. The controller software is Python based (but still using C/C++ libraries supplied by the vendors)

The platform robot contains of:
* Dagu Wild Thumper 6WD platform
* Raspberry Pi 4
* two Pololu High-Power Simple Motor Controllers G2 18v15
* Scanse Sweep LiDAR

The SLAM methods are being developed in the marckolak/graphSLAM repo.
